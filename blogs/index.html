						<h2>MARKS ARE NOT YOU.</h2>
					</div>

					<p>
						Higher marks doesn’t guarantee good career, better package or peace
						of mind.No matter how much hardwork you put in to get highest of
						them all.At the end,the one who figure’s out the perfect niche for
						himself only shines in respect to good job roles,money and a long
						fruitful career ahead.
					</p>

					<p>
						So what could we do to discover our niche,our thing to do in
						life.Our aim should be one where our interests,personality and
						skills do align.By talking to them personally you will discover
						where you are lacking and how should you start on with the process
						of self-improvement.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now,here comes the challenge to discover them,but from where:Reading
						wikipedia,seeing videos on youtube,talking to a cousin.The above we
						all have tried and got hands burned.The thing is,the job reality is
						quiet different and the guidance should come from one in position
						you desire.
					</p>
					<p>
						There will be times,you get to know the cons of your desired career
						and you will drift very soon without wasting your crucial time of
						life.

						<h2>AN ENTRPRENUER?IT’S TOTALLY COOL</h2>
					</div>
					<p>
						We are reaching towards an era where internet and technology have
						created millions of opportunity for people to grasp. And that is
						very less occupied until now.It’s totally fine if you think that
						despite of the degree’s earned,working for yourself is the best
						thing for you.
					</p>

					<p>
						Sky is the limit for a self-starter in this era where people are
						willing to explore new products/concepts to make their life easier
						and comfortable. But being an entrepreneur,it’s a lot of risk,both
						of capital and time too.In your journey of making a difference to
						the world,you need to have a mentor who have already disrupted the
						market with his concepts and work ethics.Never make the same mistake
						again as done by others,your time is most important.
